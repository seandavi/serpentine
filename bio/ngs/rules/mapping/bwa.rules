"""
Read mapping with BWA MEM (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net).

For usage, include this in your workflow.

Required:
  - bwa (0.7.5 or greater)
  - a parameter, bwa_index, that is the bwa index prefix path

Expects the global variable config
(see https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake/wiki/Documentation#markdown-header-configuration)
of at least the following structure, assuming that the desired reference sequence is some genome
to be found under the given path.

The sample/library/unit scheme allows for multiplexing while still tracking
sources of variability.

  - Samples can be run as one or more libraries.
  - Libraries can be single- or paired-end
  - Units are single sets of fastq files (from a lane or multiplexed lane)

Note the separation between samples and units that allows to have more than
one sequencing run for each sample, or multiple lanes per sample.
